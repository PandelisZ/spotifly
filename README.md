# Spotifly

Uses beacons to decide which Spotify device music should be playing from. Doesn't work particularly well - the whole beacon location thing needs a bit of work.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. Do an `npm install`
3. Copy `config.js.dist` to `config.js` and change the values to suit you
4. Run `node app.js` and visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to set it off scanning
